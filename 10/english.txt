Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613.
His early plays were primarily comedies and histories, 
and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced 
in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, 
including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some 
of the finest works in the English language.
In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, 
and collaborated with other playwrights.
